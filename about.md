Welcome! Throughout college, ever since transferring from a humanities degree to a STEM degree, I've missed writing. There never seemed to be a good time or place to write, and I feel as if I've lost whatever "touch" I used to have, or thought I had. So this blog is for me. No deadlines. No grades. Just trying to rediscover the craft.  

My other interests? Broadway musicals, Russian literature (especially Nabokov, Platonov - what can I say, I love "ov"s, enough to pursue a Slavic Studies minor in college), anything time-travel related, fiction podcasts, singing, and architecture.
