## On Writing...
Throughout college, ever since transferring from a humanities degree to a STEM degree, I've missed writing. Without a formal degree in a writing-heavy discipline, it never seemed "productive" for me to write, and so I didn't. And slowly, without realizing it, it left me: the willingness to put effort into an activity that isn't necessarily "productive," but nevertheless, important. Writing is important to me. And I almost forgot about it.

So this blog is for me. Here, there are no deadlines. No grades or rubrics. No trace of that cursed notion, "productivity." With all this post-graduation time to write, I want to find my own benchmarks, my own purpose for writing, my own creativity and joy. It was here once. I will find it again. Cheers! 

## And other interests...
Broadway musicals, Russian literature (especially Nabokov and Platonov - what can I say, I love the "ov"s, enough to pursue a Slavic Studies minor in college), anything time-travel related, technology law and policy, fiction podcasts, singing, and architecture.
