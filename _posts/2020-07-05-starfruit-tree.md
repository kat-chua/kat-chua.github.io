It is daybreak in Jakarta, Indonesia. Next to the house, there is a majestic starfruit tree on the adjacent stretch of green. The tree is nearly ten feet tall, and its fruit are bright, perfectly-formed, and sweet. So sweet, the neighbors tell their children to run up to the house, and quietly, stealthily, pluck the bright yellow starfruit that does not belong to them. Here, this summer, whoever takes, owns.

The house’s front door swings open. A young boy walks out, sleep still in his eyes. A few weeks ago, a yellow school bus would be waiting impatiently for him, the driver honking the horn. Not today. Slowly, the boy realizes that today, there is nothing new to learn in school, no classmates, no teachers, no stuffy classroom; therefore, there is everything new to learn. Dizzy with freedom, he climbs the wall next to the starfruit tree, peeks out from underneath its leaves and fruit, and pretends that he is a pirate, looking out to the blue ocean.

The boy is at that impressionable age, not quite part of the world yet. His mother expects so much of him. His father knows his wife, the way that she is; he knows his son, and understands innately that his son needs no more pressure. And so, with good intention, he doesn’t care at all, and his son gathers that all fathers exist in this world as neutral, detached creatures.

On these summer mornings, the boy’s mother has their maid harvest and serve the sweet starfruit on lily-white plates. Today, the maid opens the front door, takes in the new day, the sunlight having not taken the afternoon’s offensive blinding quality just yet. She walks to the starfruit tree, slowly. Distractedly, she wonders to herself, why there seems to be less starfruit on the tree then were there yesterday, surely, there were more. How the good, sweet things in life disappear quietly, without circumstance, slipping from one's grasp, she thought, as her brown fingers closed around firm yellow fruit.

It is years later, and the house where the boy had spent his impressionable years is gone. Only rubble now. The boy is a young man. His mother still expects so much of him; her expectation only concentrated by the years passed, acidic. The young man, returning to the house of his childhood, where everything had seemed so dearly possible, understood the weight of those expectations. Vast, pretend oceans had yielded to solid ground. He understood that fathers are not created equally, and that men are creatures not so easily understood.

The starfruit tree, that bore the sweetest fruit, the neighborhood's envy, is gone as well. All there is left is a grey cement frame around dirt, green shoots struggling for nourishment. The young man walks around where the starfruit tree was. He pictures it, realizes that now, measuring at 6 foot 2 inches, the starfruit tree might not have been as giant as it had seemed to him as a boy.

His childhood reflection broken, the young man realizes that he needs to pee. It is still a residential neighborhood, and it is clear that he will not find an intended bathroom—not for miles. He glances to the left. To the right. Unzips his pants. For old times’ sake.

And no one knew why the starfruit was so delightfully sweet.
