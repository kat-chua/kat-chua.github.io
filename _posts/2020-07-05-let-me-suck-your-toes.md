It is 8am in Berkeley, California, when a man starts yelling at me, first flirtatiously, then aggressively: “Hey... Adidas. Adidas! Adi—das! Little Adidas girl, get! Come here, Adidas!” Cue record scratch. Freeze frame. Yup... that’s me. Adidas girl. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. Well, it’s a long story.

I’m joking, it’s not. My day started just fifteen minutes prior, when my roommate asked, weakly, if I could pick up some medicine for her before going to class. I put on sweatpants, a t-shirt, and stepped into my Adidas Superstars. And out into the street I went.

The shouting continued. I ignored him, as I was trained to do— don’t make eye contact, don’t make eye contact. Walgreens was just a ten-minute walk away, and I wanted to enjoy how empty the streets were, how during the day, the two sidewalks of Telegraph Avenue were essentially expressways for swarms of students, going in opposite directions. Now, there was space to breathe. Eventually, I arrived at the Walgreens. Comforted by the generic pop music, the employees in light blue polo shirts, and the organized aisles, I took my time selecting a double pack of Dayquil and Nyquil, and two bottles of Tropicana orange juice. With these supplies in my bag, I pushed open the Walgreens door, thinking about the essay I had to write, and whether or not to text the new friend I had met at Davidson Hall the night before. What should I say? Do I have enough time between classes to have lunch with a friend and finish my essay? I was lost in my quiet little plans and social calculations, when I heard it, much nearer than before, only a few meters behind me:

“Adidas.”

I turned. Saw him. He had waited for me. He smiled wide, eyes glazed over, hair matted in debris-studded knots. Even at this distance, I could smell him. My mind raced with the horror stories my mother, friends, and the news media had instilled in me. These stories had seemed like faraway threats back in my safe hometown of Singapore, but now, the very nightmare situation my mother had threatened would occur was seemingly rearing its head. To run? Or to stand my ground? To acknowledge an imminent threat, or to continue walking away, away from hopefully just another unsettling encounter, to be forgotten in the day’s commonplace details? I decided, at that moment— taking in the Berkeley morning sunshine, the few sleepy students making their way up Telegraph Avenue to an early lecture— ***that the future crime scene details had not quite coalesced.*** I reassured myself: he was still a few meters away. If I had screamed for help, people would have looked at the distance between the two of us and remarked, he wasn’t even that near her, couldn’t grab her, grope her, carry her off.

I turned around, slowly and reluctantly. Took a shaky breath. If I only faced forwards, walking slightly but not overtly faster than usual, I could observe the shops, their owners slowly rolling up their storefronts, readying for the new day—and pretend the man was not real. I could return to my blissfully ordinary ruminations on whether or not to set up a lunch date.

“Adidas! Adidas, look at me! Why’d you got to be like that?” I again glanced back, just as he began loping, an unsteady gait, a notch faster than the meandering, straggling half-steps he was taking before. The skewed smile. I thought of the zombies in Train to Busan, fleetingly thanked God that this zombie was not anywhere near as fast. I crossed the street, in a panic, unwittingly taking myself further from home. He crossed with me. Now he was directly behind me, trailing me, a blood hound for which I was prey.

I still refused to look back, still holding out for the chance that maybe just maybe, he would lose interest. I started speed-walking, my full tote-bag swinging.

“Adidas! Come here, Adidas,” he whined, whinging, like I owed him anything.  

I turned a corner off of Telegraph, onto my street. Home was just three blocks away. My hand in my pocket, I felt for the keys, readying myself for a quick and decisive slamming of the door behind me. From behind me, the man made a noise that sounded very much like an animal snarl, but would my editorializing that noise hold up in court?

Once you run, you break the illusion. That illusion that you were ever safe and autonomous in this world. You give in, and it becomes, forever, a moment of danger. It crossed my mind: some girls never get the chance to run, and they end up dead.

“Adidas, bitch. Let me suck your toes, you fucking chink!”

Time to run.

“I just want to suck your toes, Adidas!”

Faster, and faster, my Adidas striking the sidewalk. As I ran, I heard his voice, still imploring, half begging, half threatening. In my terror, I could not discern whether the heavy thumping I heard was the sound of his feet, running behind me, or the sound my own shoes were making, or my heartbeat, pounding in my chest. His toe-related obscenities echoed down my street. I pictured the people only hearing the scene, how entertained they would be, how they would think, “Oh, classic Berkeley! Oh, what a curious shenanigan to begin the day with,” not seeing the girl frantically racing to get away in one piece.

I was running, running for my life and limb and toes, for their right to remain un-sucked, goddamn it. I propelled myself up the apartment steps, thrust key into lock, slammed the door, caught the corner of my tote bag in said door—oh god oh god oh god—retrieved it, slammed the door shut again. Peering outside the window, I was gasping, looking for any sign of him, his feet-loving, shit-eating grin. Slowly, I got my breath back. I looked at my phone. It was 8:55am.

On some days, it amuses me greatly that this man had a hankering for my toes for breakfast—
chasing a craving for these small, sometimes sour grapes. Popping them into his mouth, one at a time, tongue swirling. Toes to-go, please! Well. These toes are mine! And it is my choice to choose who sucks them, someone who I think is cute and funny and has good taste in movies, you know, given that they’re into that type of thing. And if they are, I will offer them gladly, washed, and piled-high in a silver bowl. Once inside my apartment, I placed the Nyquil, Dayquil, and orange juice by my sleeping roommate’s bed, and texted the story to my new friend.

This is a story I tell now, and yes, on some days— it’s hilarious. I got away unscathed from a toe zombie, toes still virginal. My friend looking down at my new sandals, said jokingly, “He’d like those!” My toes were never suctioned into that man’s mouth. I’m fine.

On other days, I cannot bear to spin the memory into a funny anecdote. Cannot reckon with how often girls have to choke these crazy stories back, under the guise of humor. People could say that I was never in any real danger, perhaps. He never touched me. ***Much worse things have happened to girls like me.*** But that sad reality does not cancel the real fear I felt that day, when a man, not knowing my name, saw fit to call me, in alternating waves: Adidas, bitch, chink. That morning’s ABCs.

The self-flagellating calculations, weighing how in danger I felt, what level of fear warranted breaking the peace of the morning, by running: these were computations made in broad daylight, on a run to Walgreens. ***These are calculations women have to make far too often.*** That the man was bigger, and stronger than me, and although clearly addled by who-knows-what substance, could still overpower me and take what he wanted from me, fills me with fear and rage in equal measures. He kept repeating, to the point of whining, “Let me suck your toes,” let me, give me this one thing, I deserve it, let me do it, and then I’ll go away. Never mind that I clearly had no interest in his plans, never mind, just a continued, swear-laden stream of “let me, let me.” One of the worst parts is the disenfranchisement. Even in these instances where women extricate themselves out without physical harm, it is painful, the loss of control of a day that you expected would go one way, and now has been derailed. I want to live in a world where girls do not have to make these calculations, these fight-or-flight decisions, every day. Let me be in control of my day. Let me go to Walgreens in peace. Let me be safe and feel safe at 8am, at 8pm, and onwards.

Signing off,

Adidas
